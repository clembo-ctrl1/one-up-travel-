## 💡 TIPS

**File Names Matter!**
- Keep them exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
- Don't rename files or code will break
- All files must be in the SAME folder (root level)

**Firebase Setup:**
- Site works WITHOUT Firebase (but no login/save features)
- You can set up Firebase AFTER your site is live
- Takes about 30 minutes following the guide

**Updating Later:**
- Just edit files in GitHub web interface
- Or download GitHub Desktop for easier updates
- Changes go live automatically in ~2 minutes

## 🆘 HELP

**If something doesn't work:**
1. Check all files are in the same folder
2. Make sure file names match exactly
3. Open browser console (F12) to see errors
4. Check FIREBASE-SETUP.md troubleshooting section

**Common Issues:**
- "File not found" → Check file names and folder structure
- "Firebase not defined" → Add your credentials to firebase-config.js
- "Module not found" → Make sure you're serving via HTTP (GitHub Pages does this automatically)
